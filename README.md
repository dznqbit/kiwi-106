# kiwi-106
Web-based programmer for the [Kiwi106](https://kiwitechnics.com/kiwi-106.htm).

## How to Contribute
If you notice a bug, or want a feature implemented, you have three options.
- File an issue via [Github Issues](https://github.com/dznqbit/kiwi-106/issues).
- Open a pull request. We have basic branch protection in place and I think I'm the only one who can YOLO merge, so please, I would love help completing this editor.
- Fork the project, fix it yourself, and carry on. I would prefer to keep this project up to date, but maybe I get hit by a bus tomorrow. Go nuts.
