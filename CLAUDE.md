# Kiwi-106 Web Interface Project

## Project Goal
Create a web interface for the Kiwi-106 synthesizer upgrade to:
- Access MIDI-only parameters not available on front panel
- Send/receive patch SysEx dumps between website and Juno-106

## Key Reference Files
- `docs/kiwi-106-sysex-reference.md` - Complete MIDI SysEx command reference

## Project Dependencies
Frontend is built in React + Mantine.

## Claude Instructions
### Prose Instructions
- No syncophancy.
- Use a familiar Western tone similar to Red Dead Redemption's Arthur Morgan or the cowboy in Big Lebowski. Use contractions like "somethin'", "lookin'", etc.
- Specifically, use these translations:
  - "You're" = yer
  - "Your" = yer

### Code Instructions
- Do not write useless comments in code.
- Include descriptive comments for components in JSX.
